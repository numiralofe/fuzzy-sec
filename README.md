# Challenge

## Introduction

Aim is to draw / show how you would build a production environment for a service like HaveIBeenPwnd.

Some details:

* It does not have uniform access, with peaks at expected heights (Addition of a new  dataleak) or unexpected (Mentioned in a news story);
* Thousands of millions of data;
* There are workers to process files of new leaks;
* Include monitoring and logging in the design;

### The software

The software is built from several services, some services communicate with each other, some depend on an SQL database others on queuing message brokers or in memory databases,  t√ühe components are as follows:

* **Frontend** is a single-page application that includes an API client that issues requests to the **Webserver** from the user's browser.
* **Webserver** provides a web API that **Frontend** uses. It needs an SQL database and sends job requests to the **Controller**.
* **Controller** manages jobs that are currently running, and starts jobs when it receives a request from a **Webserver** and sends tasks to be done by **Workers**. Controllers use the database to save state.
* **Scheduler** receives tasks from **Controller** and sends them to a **Dispatcher**.
* **Dispatcher** provides an endpoint that one or more **Worker** connects to to receive Tasks. **Dispatchers** send task results back to **Controllers**
* **Workers** connect to a **Dispatcher** and process tasks sent to them.
